# Wasmphobia

Wasmphobia analyzes a WebAssembly file and gives you a breakdown of what contributed to the moduleâ€™s size. This is only really useful when the WebAssembly binary has DWARF debugging data embedded.

## Usage

You can use Wasmphobia interactively on the [website](https://wasmphobia.surma.technology) or install it locally as a CLI

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/surma/wasmphobia
```
